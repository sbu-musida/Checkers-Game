## Overview
This is a classic Checkers game implemented using **React** for the front-end and the **Minimax algorithm** with alpha-beta pruning for AI decision-making. The project is designed to offer an engaging single-player experience against a challenging AI opponent.

---

## Features
- **Interactive UI**: Built with React for smooth, dynamic gameplay.
- **AI Opponent**: Powered by the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for optimal decision-making.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Configurable search depth for AI.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Move Highlighting**: Visual cues to guide players.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/checkers-game.git
   cd checkers-game
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Usage
1. Launch the app.
2. Select your preferred game settings (e.g., AI difficulty).
3. Play against the AI by clicking on a piece to see available moves, then click on the desired destination.
4. Enjoy the game! The AI will make its moves after analyzing the board.

---

## Game Rules
- Standard Checkers rules apply.
- Players take turns moving pieces diagonally.
- Pieces can capture opponent pieces by jumping over them.
- Reach the opponent's side to promote a piece to a "King" with enhanced movement.

---

## How It Works

### Minimax Algorithm
- The AI evaluates all possible moves using the Minimax algorithm, assigning scores to board states based on potential outcomes.
- Alpha-beta pruning optimizes the algorithm, reducing unnecessary calculations.

### React Integration
- The game board is rendered dynamically using React components.
- State management ensures seamless updates for moves and captures.

## Customization

### AI Difficulty
Modify the AI depth in the `settings.js` file:
```javascript
const AI_DEPTH = 3; // Adjust depth for difficulty (higher = more challenging)
```

### Styling
Update the CSS file in `src/styles/` to change the gameâ€™s appearance.
